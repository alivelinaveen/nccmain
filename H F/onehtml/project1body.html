                                Water has become a source of concern across the globe with the rapid degradation of the environment and unbridled exploitation of natural water resources. Management of water and waste water has assumed enormous significance and NCC plays a crucial role in this field.

NCC has proved to be a reliable executor of large-scale contracts within tight schedules. Working hand-in-hand with the government, NCC is working to transform the roads & highways network in the country.</P>
